# Ion Entropy Spectral Library Search

Spectral library searching is a critical technique for identifying metabolites in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. However, traditional spectral matching relies solely on peak intensities, limiting the ability to differentiate informative fragment ions from non-discriminative background ions.

This project introduces an ion informatics approach to enhance spectral similarity assessments. By computing the entropy of fragments, we can quantify the information content of ions based on their fragmentation pattern distributions. Entropy weighting allows an intensity-independent emphasis of informative ions during spectral alignment.

We implement this in an Ion Entropy and Rank-transformed Cosine (IERC) spectral similarity metric that integrates entropy weighting and intensity-to-rank conversion. This enhances signal consistency and achieves higher identification rates compared to intensity-dependent methods alone.

The repository includes:

- Functions to calculate ion entropy from fragmentation pattern distributions
- IERC spectral similarity implementation
- Application on multiple mass spec datasets demonstrating performance gains
- Selective filtering of uninformative background fragments using entropy

Overall, this project demonstrates how targeted mining of fragment ion properties through information theory metrics can improve spectral matching. Moving beyond na√Øve pattern comparisons towards extracting meaningful signals amidst complexity is a promising direction for metabolomics informatics.
